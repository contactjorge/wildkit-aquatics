      <h2>Kevin Auger</h2>

      <p>
        Entering his twentieth season, comes to us from Ontario, Canada, where he coached several
        National and Youth National level swimmers as well as PanPacific Games Medalist, NCAA
        medalist, two National Team Members and several National Development Team Members. Since
        Kevin took the helm WSO has won 3 club state championships and the Evanston Township High
        School team which he heads won 2 State championships and one National Championship. WSO has
        also had 12 of the last 13 years with at least one State champion. Kevin was a member of the

        after he finished his swimming career there, we are confident the program is in capable
        hands.
